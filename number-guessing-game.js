// Number guessing game!

// Create a file called number-guessing-game.js.
// In this file, re-write your number guessing game (from the basic javascript workshop) for the command line!
// Instead of using prompt and alert, you will have to use capabilities from NodeJS and any external module. 
// HINT: there is an npm library called prompt that can help you with that :)

// ( Number Guessing Game - The Penniless Gambler
// Generate a random number between 1 and 100. Using the browser functions prompt and alert, 
// ask the user to guess the number. You should give them 4 tries to guess the number. 
// If they guess wrong, tell them if it's higher or lower. If they guess right, congratulate them. 
// Otherwise, give them a message saying what the correct number was, as well as their list of guesses. )

// random number between 1 and 100

// counter initiation for the function
